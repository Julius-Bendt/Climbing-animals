# Climbing Animals

## Description:
Climbing animals were developed as a part of a high school project, it was developed in 2020.
The only requirement for the game was that some kind of monitazation should be in it. Our group went with iap and ads. We later wanted to remove the iap part, and instead focus more on ads that boost the player. (get 2x coins, e.g.). This project was developed in 2019.    

This project is dead. I wont be updating or maintaining it.
The code in the project does not follow my current style of coding, or up to any standards.
the code is in other words, spaghetti code and properly filled with bugs. 


## Setup:
Either clone the reposity, or import the unity package file.<br>
The latest unity version tested: UNITY_2019.4.11f1<br>
However, newer version *should* work.
